Interfaces

A type implements if it defines the method sets defined in an interface
The main purpose of interfaces is to implement polymorphism[behavioral polymorphism]
That is one function can be implemented in various ways for various types

When we use interfaces as input arguments to an function, we are stating that any type that satisfy the interface can be replaced when calling that function
